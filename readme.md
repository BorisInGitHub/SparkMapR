# Spark in mode yarn-client with MapR



###MapR sandbox
Download, Install and run the MapR sandbox MapR 5.1 : http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR/MapR+Sandbox+for+Hadoop

###Java application
I will try the yarn client mode to connect Spark to the MapR cluster
* Configure the yarn-site.xml in the resources directory
* Launch the Test Java application (I don't want to use the spark-submit process)
